      <description>A Browser is what we use to access the Internet i.e. the World. The technology has advanced to a level that we can mostly access/use everything from our palms. Out of all the software/applications the mostly helpful and useful one is a Browser.
In this post I would like to share my browser configuration and the extensions that I use to make my life a little secure, private and easier.</description>

      <description>As explained in the previous post, control groups are used to limit, prioritize, etc., the available resources in a system. In this series of post we will be creating, limiting, assigning tasks to the cgroups.
 NOTE
In this whole process I will be using a Arch-based machine with Systemd, specifically Manjaro (please don&amp;rsquo;t come after me).
 Part II - Demonstrating libcgroup We can control the cgroups using shell commands.</description>
